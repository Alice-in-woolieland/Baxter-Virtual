# Baxter-Virtual

A virtual exploration art installation!

Install one of the weirdest buildings ever made. 
It was built in 1947 by archetect Pietro Bellushi- and recreated lovingly for people to explore digitally.

The geometry has been faithfully followed from the archetectural floorplan available online.
